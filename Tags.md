# Overview #
An NFC '<b>tag</b>' is a simple paper-thin <b>passive</b> chip with between 64 and 8k bytes storage space. The shape and size of the tag can vary. _'Passive' as in has no power (battery) of its own._

Tags can be read and written by <b>active</b> NFC terminals, like a NFC reader or mobile phone with NFC support. _'Active' as in has power and can induce wireless power onto passive tags._

Bigger chips take <b>longer</b> to read and write.

# Tag types #
Tags exist with various types of technology and capacity. You are looking for <b>tags which can be NDEF-formatted</b>:

  * NFC Forum Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4

Note that write-protection is an optional feature, <b>so tag can potentially be written to by anyone with standard equipment</b>.

## Supported tag types using this plugin ##
Note that:
  * Type 2 tags are supported using an NFC reader.
  * Types 1, 2, 3 and 4 are supported through Android.

# Tag capacities #
In the same way as on your hard drive, <b>a tag's capacity is not all for you to put data on</b>. Rather some of the capacity is used for administration (just like a file-system index on a hard drive). Also note that, like hard drives, sometimes tags break and become unusable.

I recommend you at least <b>buy some 192 or 1k bytes tags for development</b>.

You could move to smaller tags later as an optimization - when you ready for production, but on the other hand, starter/developer kits are pretty cheap these days, so getting yourself one is a good starting point.

# Where to order tags online #
My experiments have been using tags from multiple suppliers, I'd recommend any that has the following:
  * Developer kit tags are clearly labeled
  * Healty suite of products available
  * Competitive prices
  * Orders delivered on time, and to many countries.
  * Informative website
